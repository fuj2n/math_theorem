# math_theorem
using my math knowledge for python codes to do theorem with proof

#why am i doing that?
im doing these because im just want to using my math knowledge on codes

and im want to explain "Archimedes method"
these method using for find pi number 

#and how is that works?
We are drawing polygons inside a circle, and as we increase the number of sides, the polygons begin to resemble the circle. By this method, the number of sides increases without limits. Using this approach, we find new digits for the value of pi.

#what am i using for that?
im using python and pygame and math library for that.Pygame allows me to draw lines , polygon , circle etc... Math allows me for 
creating equation and using that on pygame.

im just keep learning
